Belgium-based, award-winning aerial photographer Johan Vandenhecke is hosting two separate, multi-day drone photo trips to Azores, a stunning archipelago composed of nine volcanic islands in the Macaronesia region of the North Atlantic Ocean.

This is the fourth annual iteration of the trip, which takes participants around some of the world’s greatest wonders and allows them to document it via drone. In 2021, the group saw a pod of nine sperm whales, and in 2022 they saw a blue whale passing by and a big male sperm whale, who curiously meandered around the group’s boat for about 45 minutes.

The price starts at 2,500 euros for a 7-day stay, all-inclusive (you only need to pay for your own flight there). Sign up now, because groups are kept intentionally small with just six spots available per week.
